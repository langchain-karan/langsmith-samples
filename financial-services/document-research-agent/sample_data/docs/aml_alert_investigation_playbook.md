Level-2 AML alerts must be triaged within four business hours and assigned to an investigator with applicable regional credentials.

Before escalation, investigators must document transaction chronology, related-party relationships, and known customer risk profile indicators.

Escalation to the financial intelligence unit is required when unusual transaction velocity combines with unexplained source of funds.

Case closure requires explicit disposition and references to reviewed evidence sources, including internal notes and screening results.
