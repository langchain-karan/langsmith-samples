Version 3.2 adds mandatory beneficial ownership verification for legal entities with ownership structures exceeding two layers.

For retail customers, proof-of-address documents must be dated within 90 days. Prior version 3.1 allowed documents up to 120 days.

Enhanced due diligence is required for politically exposed persons and includes source-of-wealth documentation and secondary reviewer sign-off.

Onboarding cannot be completed until sanctions, adverse media, and watchlist checks return clear results or approved risk acceptance.
