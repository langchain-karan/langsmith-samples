All payment instructions must pass real-time sanctions screening before release.

Potential matches are categorized as true match, false positive, or needs review. Items marked needs review require sanctions analyst disposition within one business hour.

No operational exception may bypass screening controls. Urgent transactions may use expedited review lanes but require the same control checks.

Remediation actions and reviewer identifiers must be retained for seven years in accordance with records policy.
