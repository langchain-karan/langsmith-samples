High-value wire transfers above USD 250,000 require dual authorization before release.

Exception requests are permitted only when customer impact is severe and same-day settlement is necessary. Exceptions require approval from an operations manager and one compliance reviewer.

All approved exceptions must include rationale, case notes, and supporting evidence in the case management system within two business hours.

For cross-border wires involving high-risk jurisdictions, no exception may bypass sanctions screening. Escalation to the sanctions team is mandatory before completion.
