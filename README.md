<p align="center">Production-style sample projects that show how to build, operate, and evaluate AI workflows with LangSmith and LangChain.</p>

This repository is built for teams moving from prototype to production. Each sample models a real business workflow and demonstrates implementation patterns you can adapt to your own stack.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- `pip`
- An LLM API key (current sample uses Anthropic)
- (Optional but recommended) LangSmith API key for traces

### ⚙️ Run the Supply Chain sample

```bash
cd supply-chain/supply-chain-optimization
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Add credentials to `.env`, then run:

```bash
python example.py
```

For sample-specific details, see `supply-chain/supply-chain-optimization/README.md`.

### 💳 Run Financial Services samples

```bash
# Use Case 1
cd financial-services/document-research-agent
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python run_demo.py --query "What changed in KYC onboarding requirements between 3.1 and 3.2?"

# Use Case 2
cd ../fraud-detection-agent
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
python run_demo.py
```

## 🎓 What You Can Learn from the Current Sample

From `supply-chain/supply-chain-optimization`, you can learn how to:

- Coordinate specialized agents through an orchestration layer
- Model domain state with typed schemas and structured outputs
- Incorporate external signals into planning and decisioning
- Stream workflow execution step-by-step for real-time visibility
- Instrument end-to-end traces for operational monitoring

## 📈 Configure LangSmith Tracing (Recommended)

Set these environment variables in your `.env` file to capture traces:

```env
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=your_project_name
```

## 🧭 How to Use These Samples

- Start with one sample and run it unmodified
- Map the sample architecture to your own system boundaries
- Review how state, tools, and orchestration are modeled
- Enable tracing and inspect execution runs in LangSmith
- Adapt schemas, prompts, and routing logic to your domain data
- Define success metrics before extending a sample in production

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. If you are proposing a new sample, include:

- The business problem and target user
- Architecture overview and key design decisions
- Setup instructions and runnable example inputs
- Expected outputs and observability/tracing guidance
