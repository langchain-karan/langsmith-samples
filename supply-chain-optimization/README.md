# Supply Chain Optimization with LangGraph

A multi-agent system built with LangGraph for autonomous supply chain optimization, including demand forecasting, inventory management, and logistics optimization.

## Architecture

This system implements a multi-agent architecture with the following components:

- **Demand Forecasting Agent**: Predicts demand at SKU-location-day granularity with ML models
- **Inventory Agent**: Optimizes reorder points and multi-echelon inventory allocation
- **Logistics Agent**: Handles route optimization and real-time disruption detection
- **Orchestration Agent**: Coordinates across all agents and resolves conflicts

## Features

- Real-time demand forecasting with <15% MAPE target
- Automated purchase order generation with supplier optimization
- Real-time disruption detection and autonomous rerouting (15 min response time)
- Multi-echelon inventory optimization
- Fresh/perishable goods handling with shelf-life awareness

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Usage

```python
from supply_chain_agent import SupplyChainGraph

# Initialize the graph
graph = SupplyChainGraph()

# Run optimization
result = graph.run({
    "skus": [...],
    "inventory_data": {...},
    "external_signals": {...}
})
```

See `example.py` for a complete usage example.
